## Description

"Sakura Stream" is an Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application concept. 

The application has been designed to allow anime fans to search for anime shows. Users who sign up to the application are granted the additional privilege of being able to save any anime shows of interest to their profile.

This group project allowed for us to utilise front-end web development skills within the context of react and solidify our understanding of the use of servers in back-end web development. Through our collaborative efforts, we were able to successfully create the neccessary connections between front and back-end web development concepts to create a functional MERN application. 

## User Story
